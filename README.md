THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS PROJECTS REGARDING LANGCHAIN 

1. First project is a simple chatbot that I developed using google's api key and gemini 1.5 flash model and using langchain functions and streamlit interface
2. Second project is a little advanced where I utilised concepts of RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation). I build a streamlit interface where user could upload their pdf to query that and get results based on that
